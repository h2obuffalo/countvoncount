# countvoncount
first React native app on day 2 of react native week on developme fellowship.

An image of Count von Count and two buttons labelled + and -, in between the buttons is a number counter and below a history log.

The buttons increase/decrease the counter by 1, upto a maximum of 10 and minimum of 0. Each time a button is pressed, the action should be logged out using a timestamp and whether it was incrimented or decrimented and from what tnumber to what number.
